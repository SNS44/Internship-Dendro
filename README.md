## 🌱 The Vision

**Dendro** is an AI-powered botanical web application designed to make tree identification and nature exploration accessible to everyone — from students to environmentalists. It uses deep learning and geospatial data to instantly name a tree species from a photo, recommend the best trees for any location, and show exactly where a species thrives in the world.

This project was developed for the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship**, a program presented by the **Edunet Foundation** in collaboration with **AICTE & Shell**, focusing on **Green Skills using AI technologies**. It provides participants the opportunity to build real projects under expert industry mentorship, entirely at no cost.

## 🚀 Features

* 📷 **Identify Tree from Image** — Upload a photo of a leaf, bark, or full tree and the AI names the species instantly
* 🌲 **Recommend Trees by Location** — Enter GPS coordinates and local details to find the top 5 trees most likely to thrive in your area
* 📍 **Find Locations for a Tree** — Pick any species and see the top 10 cities and states where it historically grows most
* 🔍 **Automatic Habitat Lookup** — After identifying a tree from a photo, the app shows where it grows — no extra steps
* 🧠 **Top 3 Alternatives** — View the next best predictions for any image identification
* 🧊 **Premium UI** — Dark green sidebar, gradient title, and clean layout built with Streamlit and custom CSS

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Core Logic)

**Image Identification:**

1. Upload a photo (JPG or PNG)
2. Image is resized to 224×224 and converted to a numeric array
3. The CNN model processes the array and outputs a confidence score for every known species
4. The species with the highest score is shown as the prediction
5. If the result is categorised as "other", the app displays it as **"Unclassified / Miscellaneous Species"**
6. The geolocation dataset is automatically queried to show where that species is most commonly found

**Location-Based Recommendation:**

```
Input: Latitude, Longitude, Tree Diameter, Native Status, City, State
         ↓
Categorical Encoding (same system model was fitted on)
         ↓
StandardScaler normalises the input vector
         ↓
KNN computes distances to all historical tree observations
         ↓
Top 5 most frequent species among nearest neighbors → Recommendations
```

---

## 🎮 Usage Instructions

1. Open the app — the **dark green sidebar** shows three navigation options
2. **Identify a tree from a photo** → Select *"📷 Identify Tree from Image"*, upload your image, wait for analysis
3. **Get tree recommendations** → Select *"🌲 Recommend Trees by Location"*, fill in coordinates and area details, click *"🔍 Get Recommendations"*
4. **Find where a species grows** → Select *"📍 Find Locations for a Tree"*, pick a species, click *"🗺️ Show Common Locations"*

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Parameters

You can adjust these defaults in `treecl.py` to tune the app:

```python
TOP_N_RECOMMENDATIONS = 5    # Number of species returned by KNN
TOP_N_LOCATIONS = 10         # Number of habitat locations shown per species
IMG_SIZE = (224, 224)        # CNN input image resolution
DEFAULT_LAT = 38.2274        # Default latitude
DEFAULT_LON = -85.8009       # Default longitude
```

### Architectural Design Choices

* **Cached models** — CNN and KNN are loaded once into memory so every request is instant
* **Rescaling layer inside CNN** — images don't need manual normalisation before inference, it's handled inside the model
* **Category encoding from master list** — uses the exact same encoding order the scaler was trained on, preventing silent data mismatches
* **Automatic habitat cross-reference** — runs immediately after image prediction without any extra user action

## 🧪 Known Limitations

* CNN only recognises species it was trained on — unusual trees may be labelled as "Unclassified"
* Blurry, dark, or cluttered photos reduce prediction accuracy
* Location recommendations are based on historical observations, not live climate data
* Dataset covers mainly US cities and states — results outside that region may be limited
